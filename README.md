# History Events Tracking

This JavaScript code helps track changes in the browser's history state (pushState, replaceState, and popstate events). It overrides the default behavior of `pushState` and `replaceState` functions and dispatches custom events to listen for changes.

## Features

- **Track forward navigation** using `pushState`.
- **Track state replacements** using `replaceState`.
- **Track back navigation** using `popstate`.

## How It Works

### Overriding `pushState` and `replaceState`

This script overrides the `history.pushState` and `history.replaceState` methods to trigger custom events (`pushstate` and `replacestate`) when these methods are called. These custom events can then be listened to and used for tracking or executing additional logic.

### `popstate` Event

The script also listens for the `popstate` event, which is triggered when the user navigates backward or forward in the browser history (e.g., clicking the back button).

## Use Cases

### A/B Testing

This script is particularly useful when running A/B tests where user interactions are tracked across different page states, but the page doesn't refresh completely (for example, in a Single Page Application (SPA)):

- **Track interactions**: Track when a user moves forward or backward through different states in an A/B test.
- **Measure outcomes**: Capture and analyze different user journeys based on state changes, enabling better tracking of how a specific test variant is performing.
- **Dynamic Content**: Keep track of changes in the history state that correspond to different content shown, allowing for accurate A/B testing and analytics without full page reloads.

### Analytics Tracking

- **Event Tracking**: This script allows for better tracking of user behavior as they navigate through the site using the browser's forward and back buttons.
- **Single Page Applications (SPA)**: In SPAs where pages change without reloading, this script helps track user interactions by dispatching custom events for state changes.
- **Conversion Funnels**: Track how users navigate through different steps in a conversion funnel even when state changes do not result in a full page load.

## Usage

1. **Include the Script**: Add the script to your project to start tracking history events.

2. **Listening for Custom Events**:
   - You can add event listeners to detect when `pushState` or `replaceState` is called.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     window.addEventListener('pushstate', function(event) {
         console.log('Forward navigation detected');
         // Add your custom code here
     });

     window.addEventListener('replacestate', function(event) {
         console.log('Replace state detected');
         // Add your custom code here
     });
     ```

3. **Handling Back Navigation**:
   - The script listens for the `popstate` event to detect when the user navigates back.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     window.addEventListener('popstate', function(event) {
         console.log("Back navigation detected");
         // Add your custom code here
     });
     ```

## Example

```javascript
// ========================= Handling history states ========================
(function() {
    const originalPushState = history.pushState;
    const originalReplaceState = history.replaceState;

    // Override pushState
    history.pushState = function() {
        originalPushState.apply(history, arguments);
        // Custom event for pushstate
        const pushStateEvent = new Event('pushstate');
        window.dispatchEvent(pushStateEvent);
    };

    // Override replaceState
    history.replaceState = function() {
        originalReplaceState.apply(history, arguments);
        // Custom event for replacestate
        const replaceStateEvent = new Event('replacestate');
        window.dispatchEvent(replaceStateEvent);
    };
})();

// Listen for the custom pushstate and replacestate events
window.addEventListener('pushstate', function(event) {
    console.log('Forward navigation detected');
});

window.addEventListener('replacestate', function(event) {
    console.log('Replace state detected');
});

// Handling back navigation
window.addEventListener('popstate', function(event) {
    console.log("Back navigation detected");
});
```
